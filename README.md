# Usage
            
users start by entering an index page that prompts them to get started. After clicking the get started button, users are then presented with either their saved notes or an empty note slate. Users with saved notes can view them by clicking on the bar with the note title. Users with no saved notes can create a new one by adding a title and some descriptive text and then click the save button to have it populate on the bar to the side.

# Credits

I used express documentation on how to modularize my server. I used the class gitlab repository for figuring out how to GET and POST data to/from the database. I also had assistance with bugfixing from the TA Walter.
